# Mid-Bootcamp-Project IRONHACK

OVERVIEW

This project's kick-off point is related to home medicine stock worldwide.
It seems that while people have extra medicine stock (unused) other people can't cover their basic needs/treatments.
To analyze and go deep into this topic, we created a poll with 9 questions.

POLL

In this repository there is all the information related to poll's results/answers as well as its template.
Please refer to the files named after this to find what you need: 
poll.xlsx (raw answers), clean_poll.xlsx (ETLs answers, used for dashboards)

PYTHON CODES

The jupiter notebooks files (numbered) are related to the data cleaning and analysis process.
The used flow was open "poll" file (input) and run notebooks 1, 2, 3 to get "clean_poll" (output).
